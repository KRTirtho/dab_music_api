# DAB Music API Dart Client

DAB Music API is a Dart client for the [DAB Music Player API](https://dab.yeet.su/), providing access to music search, album info, user authentication, playlist management, and more. This package is autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification.

## Features

- Search for tracks, albums, and artists
- Get album and artist details
- Stream and download music
- Manage user favorites and libraries
- User authentication (login, register, logout)
- Playback queue management
- Lyrics retrieval

## Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
	dab_music_api: ^0.1.0
```

Then run:

```sh
dart pub get
```

## Getting Started

You need [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) as an HTTP client. Most endpoints require authentication via JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies. The default API base URL is `https://dab.yeet.su/api`.

## Usage

Basic example to search for music:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:dab_music_api/dab_music_api.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

void main() async {
	final dab = DabMusicApiClient(Dio(), baseUrl: "https://dab.yeet.su/api");
	final res = await dab.music.getSearch(q: "The Craving");
	print(jsonEncode(res));
}
```

### Authentication Example

```dart
final dab = DabMusicApiClient(Dio(), baseUrl: "https://dab.yeet.su/api");
final login = await dab.authentication.postAuthLogin(
	body: LoginRequest(email: "user@example.com", password: "password123"),
);
print(login.user);
```

### Get Album Details

```dart
final album = await dab.music.getAlbum(albumId: "54321");
print(album.album);
```

### Stream a Track

```dart
final stream = await dab.music.getStream(trackId: "12345");
print(stream.streamUrl);
```
